# ðŸ‘‹ Yo, this is Ken Ehrman of Big Nerd Ranch comin' at ya. ðŸ‘‹
## Welcome to my corner of github. 
This is the place where I will be putting things I build for fun and learning, so some of the code will probably make you chuckle a bit.

Not to worry though, I will put some more complex things here too, like anything tricky I may do for fun.

Anyway, please feel free to leave a comment.
